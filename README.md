# Scraped-News

Scraped News brings in scraped articles from www.adventures.com and populates them to the index file. The cards for each news article can be saved, which then populates them to the "Saved articles" page. Each article within the "Saved Articles" page can be commented on by clicking the "add note" button. Notes can then be viewed and deleted as the user sees fit.
